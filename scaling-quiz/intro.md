# Unit: Building Scalable Apps

When building high performance apps, you'll inevitably discover terms like `cluster`, `horizontal scaling`, `stateless`, `serverless`. Fear not!

We will master the jargon while answering key questions:

- What does it mean to build scalable apps?
- What kinds of scaling strategies exist?
- What does `performance` mean for my app?


> This unit will help you establish the skills required to handle scaling web applications.

## Learning goals

In this unit you will learn to:

- Determine relevant performance considerations.
- Precisely discuss performance considerations & observations with a team.
- Efficiently locate performance issue(s).
- Identify potential mitigation & solutions.
